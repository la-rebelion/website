Helmee for kubernetes, that can make the life of Kubernauts easier and save them tons of time.

Deploying complex applications in Kubernetes is not easy, helm is a good option to package applications, but helm is complex as well, because the learning curve is hard.

Helmee is the simple, fast and easy way to deploy your applications in different environments in a blink of an eye. Helmee is a tool built on top of Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes. Itâ€™s designed to make it easy to create, deploy and manage applications in any environment, like production, staging and development. It is fast and easy to use for developers and system admins alike.

Helmee is the best tool to manage your Kubernetes applications with a quick and familiar interface for Kubernauts. It will allow you to override current templates for Helm charts, deploy them in any environment and track their releases, helping you to save time and money on DevOps tasks.

Helmee is implemented in JavaScript using the same idea that Helm, based on templates, but allowing you to create specific workspaces for every single environment that you use in real life projects; it is open for Beta test, only by invitation and for limited time, so, register to get included in the waiting list.

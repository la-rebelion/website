Our Jekyll themes, that make use of `_data` files to customize the content, provide JSON schema to help you in [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) your files. Example (very first line):

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schemas.rebelion.la/dev-conf-v1.0.json
name: We Are Developers 2024
slug: we-are-developers-2024
... # this is just the head example, continue
```


You can find out more info about customizing our Jekyll themes in the README file.

DevConf is a free Bootstrap 5 for Jekyll. The idea of this template is to emulate 
an Eventbrite like website. See the template live [here](https://la-rebelion.github.io/DevConf-Jekyll-Theme).

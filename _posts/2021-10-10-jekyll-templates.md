    Some nice Jekyll templates customizables with `_data` files.

Our Jekyll themes, that make use of `_data` files to customize the content, provide JSON schema to help you in [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) your files. Example (very first line):

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schemas.rebelion.la/dev-conf-v1.0.json
name: We Are Developers 2024
slug: we-are-developers-2024
... # this is just the head example, continue
```


You can find out more info about customizing our Jekyll themes in the README file.

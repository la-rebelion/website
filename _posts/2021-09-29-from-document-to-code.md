    Some tools generate documentation from code, FroDoc generates code 
    from documentation. Is a Continuous Documentation solution to keep docs and code always in sync!

"Continuous Everything" is the _New Approach to Product IT Operating Model_, and with FroDoc we are 
looking to add value to this model, allowing the Business responsible, Operations team and to work even more in sync.

**Who** are the systems and solutions architects after all? They are SMEs solving problems with 
specific tools/software, before becoming **Super Master Expert**, or Subject of Matter Expert, 
for sure these guys were (or still are) developers, they spent lots of time programing on that 
specific software/product/solution/framework they know from E2E. They can speak with business people 
and with technical teams, they are the bridge between these two worlds. Using [FroDoc](https://frodoc.rebelion.la), they can speak both languages, business and technical, at the same time.

**What** do developers love most? **To code**; yes, we also love to learn something new, being 
challenged and taking part of light speed moving industry that never ceases on creating new technologies, frameworks, standards, you name it. With [FroDoc](https://frodoc.rebelion.la) you "code the documentation", then, FroDoc transforms the documents into a specific programing language to run microservices or Smart Contracts, yes, Smart Contracts as well.

Other important piece in [FroDoc](https://frodoc.rebelion.la), is **GitOps**, because with it, we can provide a mechanism to safely deploy manifest files stored in a Git repository. By using Git as the single source of truth, operators and developers can see what changes were made, conduct code reviews, and automate testing. With GitOps tooling it is possible to monitor changes in the repository and safely applying updates to the different environments.

FroDoc's goal is to enable developers to manage the environments and solutions without having to worry about the underlying platform, neither requiring deep knowledge of sysadmin, because solutions can be automatically deployed in different environments.

When something changes, which is too frequent, even more if you are applying an agile model with frequent releases, then, with [FroDoc](https://frodoc.rebelion.la), documentation is updated, and code will change automatically.
